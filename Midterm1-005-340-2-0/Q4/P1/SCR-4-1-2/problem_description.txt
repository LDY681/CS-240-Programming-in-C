                            REDIRECTING INPUT
                            _________________

These problems do not use FILE i/o within the program, instead they use input
redirection to send a file's contents to "stdin" which the program will read
from.  This can be done by running the program like so:
		./mytest < sample_input.txt

Input can also be entered manually by running the compled program, then
entering each desired input value.  When you are done entering values, you will
need to let the program know you are finished by pressing "ctrl + d".  This
sets the EOF flag.


                             HELPFUL FUNCTIONS
                             _________________

getchar(), ungetc(...), atoi(...), scanf(...), printf(..), getline(...)
	Remember that you have access to the 'man' pages.


                             PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
                             ___________________

You will create your own SCR-4-1-2.c file that contains the function
`void printTriangles()`.  This function reads in a stream of integers from
stdin. The input will be a list of integers that are separated by a space.
After the final integer in the file, there will immediately be a newline
character to signal that all of the integers have been read. For each integer,
a right triangle of asterisks is printed whose height and base is the number
read.  Each triangle is  followed by a new line.  An extra  newline is added
after each triangle except the last, see below.


                             EXAMPLES
                             ________

Input File contains:  "3 2 4\n"
Function Outputs:     "***\n
                       **\n
                       *\n
                       \n
                       **\n
                       *\n
                       \n
                       ****\n
                       ***\n
                       **\n
                       *\n
                       \n"

Input File contains:  nothing or empty file
Function Outputs:     "No integers were provided.\n"
